# Part I: Hardware

## projects

### 01: Elementary Logic Gates
Given a `Nand` chip, build elementry logic gates using Hardware Description Language (HDL)

### 02: ALU
With previously built logic gates, build ALU for HACK computer in HDL

### 03: Memory
Given a primitive DFF (Data Flip-Flop) chip and previously built logic gates, build Register and Memory up to 16K in HDL

### 04: Machine Language
Familiarize with the symbolic HACK machine language specification (assembly language)

### 05: Computer Architecture
Given display (+ driver), primitive keyboard as input device, ROM, and previously built components, build CPU & Memory, and combine everything into a freakin' HACK computer !!!

### 06: Assembler
Write assembler in a high-level programming language (Ruby in my case) which translates HACK assembly language into HACK machine language
